                    Oyster mushrooms are a group of edible fungi characterized by their oyster-shaped caps and layered gills. They grow rapidly, adapt to various substrates (such as straw, sawdust, and coconut coir), and produce multiple flushes of fruiting bodies. Their mycelium forms a white, web-like network during colonisation, and when provided with proper conditions—humidity, fresh air exchange, and temperature shifts—these mushrooms reliably fruit indoors and outdoors.
